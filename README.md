# freeCodeCamp-portfolio
Collection of finished freeCodeCamp labs and projects.

This is where I am saving and showing my work that I have been doing on freeCodeCamp.org.  A great place to learn and practice coding skills.  I really enjoy the set up of projects giving me the oppurnity to get good hands on learning with the programming languages I wish to gain more knowledge of.
